Installation Manual for libMAX7221 

This short HOWTO describes the installation procedure for libMAX7221 on Linux. 

Prerequisites: 
- GNU binutils and GNU gcc compiler for AVR MCUs; 
- AVR-libc. 

Build and Installation 

1. Navigate to the folder with the library source code. 

2. Build the library with: 

  #make [mcu|cpu_freq] 

No parameters provided, make builds the source for Atmega328p MCU with CPU frequency of 4MHz. 
The target MCU and/or CPU frequency can be changed either by editing the Makefile (variables $MCU and $CPU_FREQ) or using the command line arguments: 

- mcu=<mcu name> 
- cpu_freq=<frequency as long integer value> 

For example: 

  #make mcu=atmega32 cpu_freq=16000000L 

will build the library for Atmega32 MCU with frequency of 16MHz. Any missing argument will be replaced with its 
default value from Makefile.

3. Install the library by executing: 

  #sudo make install 

A copy of the library archive will be made in /usr/local/lib/avr8 folder while
the header file will end up in /usr/local/include/avr8 folder.

4. Uninstalling the library 

  #sudo make uninstall
