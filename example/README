The library is distributed with the following examples:
- libMAX7221example.c;
- libMAX7221example2.c.


They are tested on Atmega328p microcontroller.

Building the examples

The examples can be built using the existing Makefile by executing:

	#make libMAX7221example
	#make libMAX7221example2

or

	#make all 

libMAX7221 must be installed before building the examples.

The variables $LIBRARY_PATH and $HEADERS_PATH from the Makefile defines the library installation folder and the location
of the library header file. The default locations are:

- /usr/lib/avr/lib/atmega328p;
- /usr/lib/avr/include.

Update those variables with the locations of the installed libMAX7221 library.
